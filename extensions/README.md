Extensions
==========

These are extensions to the music box to make it more awesome, but does not
involve actually modifying the music box itself.

Current Projects
----------------

 - `externalbox/`: An external wooden box that is suppose to make the musicbox
                   look nice. My main motive is that I want to be able to gift
                   people a cool music box and the stock mechanical box set is
                   just too rough for that.
