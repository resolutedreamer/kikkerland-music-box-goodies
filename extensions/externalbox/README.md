The external box consists of a couple of parts:

 - The main chamber: this chamber holds the musicbox. Preferably made out of
   something like wood so it can resonate better.
    - File: MAINCHAMBER.DWG
 - The resonator chamber: this chamber is for resonating. 
    - File: RESONATORCHAMBER.DWG
    - Notes: The size of this is not yet finalized.
 - The connector plates: These plates connects the main chamber with the
   resonator chamber.
    - File: CONNECTOR\_PLATE.DWG
    - Notes: This is the simplest piece. You could also use anything else as
      a substitute as long as it follows the dimensions.
 - The lid: Not yet designed.
 - The hinge: Purchased hinge from home depot.
    - It's called "Middle Hinges" by a company named "Schlage". Comes in
      a pack of two and is about $2.50.
    - The product code is 04407442954.
 - Machine screws and nuts: holds everything together.
    - The screw that screw into the music box is M3-.5 x 12MM machine screws.
    - Other screws are all #8-32 x 1/2'' machine screws. I bought flathead for
      better appearance. The one holding the hinge is gold as it blends in 
      (again, for appearance).

3D model is not yet done.
