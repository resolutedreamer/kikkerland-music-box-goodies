The external box consists of a couple of parts:

 - The main chamber: this chamber holds the musicbox. Preferably made out of
   something like wood so it can resonate better.
    - File: MAINCHAMBER.DWG
 - The resonator chamber: this chamber is for resonating. 
    - File: RESONATORCHAMBER.DWG
    - Notes: The size of this is not yet finalized.
 - The lid: Not yet designed.
 - The hinge: Purchased hinge from home depot.
    - It turns on the the hinge that I bought was not the size I want. So some
      redesign might need to be done.
 - Machine screws and nuts: holds everything together.
    - The screw that screw into the music box is M3-.5 x 12MM machine screws.
    - Other screws are all #8-32 x 1/2'' machine screws. I bought flathead for
      better appearance. The one holding the hinge is gold as it blends in 
      (again, for appearance).

3D model is not yet done.
