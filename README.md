Kikkerland Music Box DIY Goodies
================================

The [Kirkkerland mechanical music box](https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/8f7f/?srp=1)
is a neat toy that allows you to make your own music. This repository is 
dedicated to extensions and other designs that extends the music box 
functionalities. 

For now all I have are some custom sheets for the music box that you could
print. I have different sizes drawn up in AutoCAD 2013 Student edition and 
saved in the AutoCAD 2013 dwg formats. Hopefully I will be able to export it
into a PDF of the correct size as I don't know where I could print this yet.

Eventually I want to make a box that covers the whole thing so it looks pretty
and perhaps motorizing the whole system with a gear and some servos/motors.
