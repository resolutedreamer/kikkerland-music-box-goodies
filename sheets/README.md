Sheets!
=======

These sheets here are for your printing pleasure. The PDF files is under the
pdf folder, which is not available yet as I need to figure out how to turn
these into reality.

The dimension of the paper is as follows (Not tested yet, will test once
printed):

 - Width: (82 + 32 \* {measures})mm (18 measures is 82 + 32\*18 = 658mm)
   (Note that this doesn't count the triangular part in the beginning)
 - Height: 41mm (Again doesn't count for the the triangular part in the 
   beginning)
 - Triangular part width (perpendicular from the pointy end to the line): 15mm
 - Between each horizontal line: 2mm
 - Between each vertical line: 4mm
 - Total number of horizontal lines: 15
 - Margin-top: 6.5mm
 - Margin-bottom: 6.5mm
 - Margin-left: 25mm (to where the triangle starts, 40mm all the way to the end)
 - Margin-right: 24/25mm
 - Notes (it's an palindrome!): CDEFGABCDEFGABC
 - First measure starts on the 3rd solid line after the left most vertical
   solid line
 - Last measure ends on the 3rd last solid line after the right most vertical
   solid line.

I stole the cleft from http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/AutoCAD-2006/Treble-Clef/td-p/1693839#.UMo8NtGYMYw
Took the solid model and flattened it in its top view.

Naming of the files is:

    <Number of measures>MEASURES_<time signature>.dwg

Example: `18MEASURES_4_4.dwg` is 18 measures with a time signature of 4/4

`ALL_IN_ONE.DWG` is a file that I work in as it has the layers conviniently 
done so I don't have to mess with that everytime I start a new file.

All files are done in in AutoCAD 2013 Educational Edition.
